## Description
This project is a Flask application that extracts text from images and translates it from French to English using the DeepL API and Tesseract OCR.

It was made because as I am learning french, I wanted to play video games in french and having a tool I can easily paste screenshots to into to translate helps a lot.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexbhas/frOCR
cd frOCR
pip install -r requirements.txt
